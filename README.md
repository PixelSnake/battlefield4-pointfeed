# What is this?

A React app that recreates a Battlefield 4 point feed, for use in video editing or whatever.

## Adding the purista font

Unfortunately, the Battlefield 4 font is not publicly available. You will probably be able to find a download link somewhere on the internet, but I'm not able to include it in this repo. It is called "Purista", just google it, fingers crossed.
